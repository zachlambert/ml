The objective of this machine learning library is to help me understand machine learning techniques by implementing them myself.

Each machine learning problem involves taking data and processing it in some way, to perform some objective.

For each class of machine learning problem, a dedicated class will be used to provide an interface for that problem.
These classes will provide functions for selecting the model to use, which separates the interface of the problem and the implementation used.

These classes should provide the complete API for setting up a machine learning problem; providing data; selecting a model, or range of models; evaluating performance; and proving the desired output, such as predictions.
